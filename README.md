# calculator
This is me learning how to make a calculator.


What are the folders
Answers: This was a script that was generated from ChatGPT. The HTML and CSS is mine 
attempt1: This was the code I attempted by myself. The issue was that it used so much if statements that it was so hard to keep track of things.
- How it worked was that calculation area was blank
- I only programmed most functions for button 9 (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division)
- First value is entered in the id calculationArea
- You click on the operator you want to use (initiially false but then set to true when clicked.)
- The next value is then entered in the initial area
- You then click equals which then calculates depending on which is true
- 

attempt2: This was a simplified version by following a video tutorial followed by ChatGpt
- I used ChatGpt to simplify the if statements and styling the page
